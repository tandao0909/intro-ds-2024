This repository is created for my group to work on a project in the Intro to DS class. All the data is in the `csv_files` folder.

All the data come from the [Index 30 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thangtranquang/stock-vn30-vietnam). This project aims at trying to create a model capable of predicting the pattern from this time series dataset. Here is a suggested guideline:
- Divided the dataset into 80% training set, 20% test set (which means the first 8 years as train set and 2 last years as test set).
- Using ARIMA method for a benchmark.
- Using time series (possibly attention and stuffs =)))) ) to beat the benchmark.
- Visualize and polish the result.
